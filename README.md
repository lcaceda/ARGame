## description
ARGame is nerdy game in which you can test your knowledge of the Atlanta Region. The questions span the subjects of population, housing, income, water, transit, and active transportation. Some of the answers are sure to surprise even the most-seasoned city planner.

####how to play
1. visit the deployment link: <http://lcaceda.github.io/ARGame/>
2. start clicking on any of the 20 squares. 
3. each square has a question, two radio button relating to the buttons, a link to hint (well, all but one box has a hint), and a submit button.
4. take your best guess at selecting a correct answer
5. after you submit an answer the question box will fade away.
6. scroll down to the button of the page to see how you did!

##cool-ish features
1. the boxes disappear so you can better track the questions you've already answered
2. if a question is submitted without a response, it doesn't mess up the score.
3. hint links open up in a new window.
4. it's responsive!
